# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-in-Power-BI

In this Power BI case study, I examine a dataset from Databel, a telecom company, to analyze their churn rates. Churn analysis is a critical process that requires not only knowing the churn rate but also understanding the reasons behind the churn rate and developing strategies to reduce it. By analyzing churn rates, we can identify patterns, trends, and potential causes of churn. We can then use this information to design targeted interventions to improve customer retention. Effective churn analysis requires a deep understanding of customer behavior, preferences, and experiences, as well as the ability to extract insights from complex data sets. In this case study, I explore various techniques and tools for churn analysis in Power BI, including time intelligence calculations, data visualization, and DAX functions, to help Databel reduce their churn rate and improve customer satisfaction.
